At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (44,45.9,93) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 99.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (43,43.2,51) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 62.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,25.5,44) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 37.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (43,40.8,69) frames.
Overall, ng5_S accounts for 6.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,24.2,40) frames.
Overall, ling4_S accounts for 6.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,25.0,39) frames.
Overall, jat1_S accounts for 6.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,18.5,27) frames.
Overall, ji6_S accounts for 6.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,24.9,47) frames.
Overall, saam1_S accounts for 6.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (31,32.7,48) frames.

Overall, baat3_S accounts for 5.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,23.2,34) frames.
Overall, luk6_S accounts for 5.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (21,21.6,32) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 48.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 52.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 2.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.2 hours of data, or 0.6 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 6.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (6,9.9,27)
