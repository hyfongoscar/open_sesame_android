Overall, ji6_S accounts for 5.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,27.7,54) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 49.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 51.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 2.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.2 hours of data, or 0.6 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 5.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (9,12.8,31)
